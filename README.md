# Learning MuZero Through Implementation

A no-frills basic implementation of MuZero using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Currently, it is using naive search rather than monte carlo tree search similar to [gehot's](https://github.com/geohot/ai-notebooks) implementation. I think it's working on OpenAI's [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) environment. I'm working now to get the mcts implemented.
